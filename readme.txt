For ease of grading, this folder is organized into each person's scene, and then complied into the "Combined Assets" folder.
To run any individual person's animation, make sure MATLAB is using images and functions from the chosen person's folder.
To run the master animation, make sure MATLAB is using images and functions from the Combined Assets folder.

NOTE: The scripts containing each of our individual animations are called
main.m - Chris and Matt
animation_ian.m - Ian
AnimationTim.m - Tim

Thank you!
